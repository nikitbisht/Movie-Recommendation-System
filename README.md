## Important Notice
Due to the recent ban on The Movie Database (TMDB) in India, we are currently unable to provide visualizations through movie images. This limitation may affect the overall user experience, particularly in displaying movie posters and related graphics.

We are exploring alternative sources and solutions to enhance the visualization aspect of our project. Your understanding and support during this time are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your patience!
